## Megatools in docker

Megatools installed on debian image.

Why? Because megatools are available as debian package only in sid.
If you are not running on sid, then you are forced to compile yourself.

## Usage

This image is meant to be used from CLI.

Edit the megarc file, input your credentials and then edit the docker-compose.yml file as needed.

Put the command you want executed in the command value and just start up the container.
